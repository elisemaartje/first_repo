```

## R Markdown

This report documents my first attempts at using Git and Github to version control an Rstudio project. I will be modifying this report, staging and committing changes and then pushing to Github.

Lets create a test plot of speed (mph) and distance (miles)

```{r, test-plot}
plot(cars, col = "red", xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Distance (miles")
```

a summary of the data frame is given below

```{r, cars-summary}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```
